<img src="https://www.bycape.io/shareimage.png" alt="My Project Screenshot" width="550" height="300">
This project was made during my internship as a Software developer in a small SaaS company called Cape. The companies main focus is on creating a marketing platform which helps clients start launch and monitor their marketing campaigns.

## My task
My task was improving the user-experience in this huge platform and more specifically improve the productivity of its users, this is where my project comes in hand. The voice-over generator's purpose is the straight line of the voice-over creation which are key part of the ads which are in a video format. The main problem that i had to solve was how can i achieve this in a way that i can save time and money not only to the user but also the company, after some brainstorming and research i came to the conclusion that AI is the perfect answer to the problem that i was trying to solve. In order to achieve the task of generating quality voice-overs, i decided that ElevenLabs was the perfect option to the problem. 

## Why i chose ElevenLabs? 
I choose this models since it was a really all around package that combines quality voice over audio, customization, voice cloning as well as great API documentation. 

## How did i achieve the task? 

Since the company was using certain technology stack for the achievement of their goals, i had to comply with their choice. 

* **React.js:** In order to visualize the idea in the working product, i used React.js 

* **ScSS:** I used ScSS is order to translate the design in to a nicely arranged UI

* **Material UI:** Used for component library i also used some custom components that Cape's developers have already made
  
* **TypeScript:** Back-end framework for handling the API calls and requests

Unfortunately I can't show any code because of company policies, however i can show demo videos of how the tool works.
